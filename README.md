- 👋 Hi, I’m @martinatjie
- 👀 I’m interested in a vast galaxy of things; all of which influence what I code. Expect to see a variety of projects hidden in my repo's inspired by what I love, be it arts and crafts, design, games, nifty tools, mental health or even baking. When the COVID pandemic hit I noticed how important it is to develop solutions that keep us connected, so a lot of projects you will see in my repo's revolve around nourishing togetherness.
- 🌱 I’m always learning multiple things simultaneously. That's just how my brain works and I have embraced to accept it ;-) Even though I come from a purely C#/.Net background, I always try to expand my skillset by researching what I don't know yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are filled with passion for "making the world a better place" and helping more self-taught developers out there.
